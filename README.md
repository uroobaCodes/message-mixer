# Message Mixer
This was a Codecademy Project. My functions are different because I am **not** using regex. In the codecademy project, they are using regex in the caesar cipher function. This project allows you to apply various encryption techniques, such as Caesar cipher, Symbol cipher, and Reverse cipher, to your messages.
## Features
**Caesar Cipher:** Shift characters by a specified amount in the alphabet.

**Symbol Cipher:** Replace certain characters with their symbol equivalents (e.g., "i" becomes "!" and "1" becomes "l").

**Reverse Cipher:** Reverse the letters of each word in the input sentence.

### Installation
To use this project, youâ€™ll need Node.js installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from the official website.
### Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/message-mixer.git
- cd message-mixer
### Run the Project
- Open a terminal in the project directory.
- Use the following command to run the project, specifying the encryption type and the amount (for Caesar cipher):

```node app.js <encryptionType> <encryptionAmount>```
### Encryption Types:
**symbol:** Apply the symbol cipher (e.g., "i" becomes "!")

**reverse:** Reverse each word in the input sentence.

**caesar:** Apply Caesar cipher with a shift of the specified amount.

### Example
```Caesar Cipher (Shift 3)```

**Input:** hello world

**Output:** khoor zruog

```Symbol Cipher```

**Input:** i love 1$

**Output:** ! l0v3 1$

```Reverse Cipher```

**Input:** hello world

**Output:** olleh dlrow

## ðŸ”® Future Learning
I am trying to learn how to perform verification and validation using Node.js and also to send an email confirmation to users after they verify. For that I am thinking of also supplementing this idea with increasing my knowledge about databases, starting with MongoDB.
